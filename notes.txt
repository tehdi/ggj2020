set number of dice per player
vs
set number of dice per game, divided between players however they choose
WINNER: dice per game, so the balance isn't broken with more or fewer players


buy things with sum of rolled dice (6 + 2 = 8)

    Sam wants less luck
    we agreed that it must be an exact sum, else players just bank high numbers
vs
roll specific dice patterns (6 + 2 = a six and a two)
    after trying the other two, we don't want this.
vs
hybrid: money is a sum, research is a pattern
    we both like this better than raw sums
WINNER hybrid: sum-money, pattern-research


the player who rolls the dice chooses their fate
    with input from other players if wanted

carbometer scale = ~0 to 20,000
    mission values = ~7 to 3,000
    carbometer start position = ~8,500
        split it into thirds (~7k per) and start the meter on the low end of the mid third
    playtest this to figure out what numbers work

TODO
- add a timer to limit a "year"
    players have a limited amount of time available to complete one of the available missions
    if the timer expires before they do, the missions recycle
    if they complete one, it shows some info about what they did, then the missions recycle
    either way, there's a ~5-10s delay before the new missions load and the timer starts again
    during the delay, any "mission complete" input is ignored
