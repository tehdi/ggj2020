set number of dice per player
vs
set number of dice per game, divided between players however they choose
WINNER: dice per game, so the balance isn't broken with more or fewer players


buy things with sum of rolled dice (6 + 2 = 8)

    Sam wants less luck
    we agreed that it must be an exact sum, else players just bank high numbers
vs
roll specific dice patterns (6 + 2 = a six and a two)
    after trying the other two, we don't want this.
vs
hybrid: money is a sum, research is a pattern
    we both like this better than raw sums
WINNER hybrid: sum-money, pattern-research


the player who rolls the dice chooses their fate
    with input from other players if wanted

carbometer scale = ~0 to 20,000
    mission values = ~7 to 3,000
    carbometer start position = ~8,500
        split it into thirds (~7k per) and start the meter on the low end of the mid third
    playtest this to figure out what numbers work
